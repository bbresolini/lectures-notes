# The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763-1789

## Chapter 1
This chapter describes the war situation of Britain in the mid-seventeenth century. 

The _Seven Years War_ (1756-1763) was a conflict between Britain, Prussia, France and Spain. 
Until 1757, Britain was losing because of "ineptitude, stupidity, and, some said, cowardic" of its military leaders. 
Although when this leaders gave up office and William Pitt heads the new ministry, called by George II, things starts to change.

Pitt adopted a new strategy focusing Britain troops on New World and resourcing Prussia to fight France in the Continent. In Jully 1758, Britain won their first battle, tooking French fortress of Louisbourg and following a series of English victories.

When Britain first, at heaven's command,
Arose from out the azure main;
This was the charter of the land,
And guardian angels sung this strain
"Rule Britannia, rule the waves;
Britons never will be slaves."

Quando a Grã-Bretanha, a primeira, sob o comando do céu,
Surgiu das profundezas do azul oceano;
Esta foi a carta da terra,
E anjos guardiões cantaram este refrão:
"Domina, Britânia, domina as ondas;
Britânicos nunca serão escravos."
