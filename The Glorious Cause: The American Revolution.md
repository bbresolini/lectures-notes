When Britain first, at heaven's command,
Arose from out the azure main;
This was the charter of the land,
And guardian angels sung this strain
"Rule Britannia, rule the waves;
Britons never will be slaves."

Quando a Grã-Bretanha, a primeira, sob o comando do céu,
Surgiu das profundezas do azul oceano;
Esta foi a carta da terra,
E anjos guardiões cantaram este refrão:
"Domina, Britânia, domina as ondas;
Britânicos nunca serão escravos."
