# Utilitarianism

Is an 1861 essay written by John Stuart Mill about moral philosophy.
His goal is to stabilish the *Principle of Utility* or the *Greatest-Happines Principle* as the norm of conduct. 

The second paragraph starts stating that all sciences, including Math, has the same reliability. 
The author defends that statement by arguing that the doctrines of those sciences are not deducted from their respective First Principles.
I can not know about others sciences,
however specifically in mathematics I know that Zarmelo and Fraenkel structured it into *Set Theory*, that is,
all mathematical theorems are deducted from the *7 Axioms*. 
Although the *Set Theory* was first introduced in 1908, in the historical circumstances that Mill was in, this statement would be a fact.

> "The truths which are ultimately accepted as the first principles of a science, are really the last results of metaphysical analysis,
practiced on the elementary notions with which the science is conversant"
