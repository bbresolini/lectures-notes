# Utilitarianism

Is an 1861 essay written by John Stuart Mill about moral philosophy.
His goal is to stabilish the *Principle of Utility* or the *Greatest-Happines Principle* as the norm of conduct. 

The second paragraph starts stating that all sciences, including Math, has the same reliability. 
The author defends that statement by arguing that the doctrines of those sciences are not deducted from their respective First Principles.
I can not know about others sciences,
however specifically in mathematics I know that Zarmelo and Fraenkel structured it into *Set Theory*, that is,
all mathematical theorems are deducted from the *7 Axioms*. 
Although the *Set Theory* was first introduced in 1908, in the historical circumstances that Mill was in, this statement would be a fact. 

> "The truths which are ultimately accepted as the first principles of a science, are really the last results of metaphysical analysis, practiced on the elementary notions with which the science is conversant; and their relation to the science is not that of foundations to an edifice, but of roots to a tree, which may perform their office equally well though they be never dug down to and exposed to light"

I do think this is how sciences philosophy structures the bases of its sciences. However I desagree with the last part.It seems that from, Mill's perspective, the "roots" of the science is some metaphysical truth, on which science is based. In my perspective, sciences rely on physical truths. The empirical phenomena are the Truths/Facts in witch science apply their methods to discover the causality or initial conditions that leads to the final state or result. In other words, *the first principles of a science, the empirical facts or phenomena, relates to the science as a foundations to an edifice*.

The next paragraph discuss about the *natural faculty, sense or instinct* that inform us about right and wrong. Those who defend this faculty categorize her as "it is a branch of our reason, not of our sensitive faculty; and must be looked to for the abstract doctrines of morality, not for perception of it in the concrete". Moreover, he describes how both school (intuitives and inductives) insists on the necessity of general laws.
